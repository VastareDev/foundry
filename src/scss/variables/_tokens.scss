/**
 * Foundry Token Surface
 *
 * The tokens entrypoint exposes the public design token API for Foundry.
 * It aggregates internal token modules (options, colour palette, theme, 
 * body, spacing, and typography) into a single import surface so consuming
 * projects can depend on one stable path instead of multiple internals.
 *
 * Any new token module intended for public use should be forwarded here
 * to remain part of the official, versioned token contract.
 *
 * @version 1.0.0 (file)
 * @since   0.1.0 (release)
